# 🧳 TravelDiary - A MERN Stack Travel Story Application

Welcome to **TravelDiary**, a full-stack web application I developed to provide users with a digital space to document and relive their travel experiences.

As a travel enthusiast and software developer, I wanted to build something meaningful and personal — a platform where users can create, update, and delete their travel stories, complete with titles, descriptions, locations, dates, and photos. TravelDiary offers an elegant and user-friendly interface backed by robust backend architecture to ensure your memories are stored securely and are easy to manage.

This project not only allowed me to strengthen my skills in the **MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js)** stack but also helped me explore features like user authentication, image uploads, and responsive design. Whether you're exploring a new city or sharing past adventures, **TravelDiary** lets you tell your story — your way.
